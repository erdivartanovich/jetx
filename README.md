# JETX a NodeJS HTTP routing library

just a tiny http server inspired by express

## Motivation

Do you ever use express.js? well, it is the most popular NodeJs framework to build web service. This project is just a way to show how we can build a library like that, while also demonstrating how NodeJS work. It consists of a routing system and middleware only, nothing more. The routing part is run on top of my own simple EventEmitter container, and it just a single-segment URL pattern matching using array filtering, well that is bad, for demonstration purpose, I don't want to make it complicated. NodeJS itself has already provided the better EventEmitter package, but I just want to show, how the concept works.

## Features

- Simple Routing
- Middleware
- Built in 404 error response

## Installation

make sure you have NodeJS (latest version is recommended) installed in your local

```sh
    $ npm install jetx
```

## Example/ how to use

- create a file for example: index.js

write these codes in the file:

```js
    const jetx = require('./index');

    const app = new jetx();
    app.get('/', function(req, res) {
        res.send(`<h1>hello world from JetX</h1>
            <p>
            This is the the index page.
            <br> This lib came with simple routing, middleware, and default 404 error page.
            <br> Go try to hit an undefined route such as, <a href="http://localhost:8080/xxx">here</a>
            </p>
        `);
    });

    app.get('/test', function(req, res) {
        const result = {
            id: 1,
            name: "erdi",
        }
        res.json(result);
    });

    app.post('/', function(req, res) {
        res.send('this is the post response');
    });

    // using middleware
    const mymiddleware = (req, res) => {
        console.log('incoming request', (new Date).getTime(), req.url)
    }

    app.use(mymiddleware);
    app.listen(8080);
```

now run :

```sh
    node index.js
```
